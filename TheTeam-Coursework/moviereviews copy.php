        <p> As far as the biggest films go, it’s been a year of postponements and delays, but the good news is that means there are still loads of big movies to look forward to in 2021, and with the recent promising vaccine news it hopefully won’t be long till we can get back to normal cinema-going habits.</p>

                <h4>Deadpool (2016)<br> Rotten tomatoes score=85% | IMBD rating=8.0/10</h4>
                <a href="DeadpoolReview.html"> <img class="photo" src='Images\Deadpool.jpg'> </a>
                <p class="review-text">I found myself both enjoying the character and certain gags, while wishing I could skip ahead 2-3 years to see the presumably superior sequel. I really don’t care about how Wade Wilson got his powers and became Deadpool. I’d care more about his would-be romance with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) if the movie gave her more than one great scene.  Wade and Vanessa’s meet-cute, which involves a verbal sparring match over who had the most horrible childhood, is a classic case of giving said female lead a strong opening beat and then sidelining her for the rest of the movie. Yet the picture really expects me to care if Wade can summon up the courage to show off his hideous new face to his former girlfriend.</p>

                    <h4>Pulp Fiction (1994)<br> Rotten tomatoes score=92% | IMBD rating=8.9/10</h4>
                    <a href="PulpFictionReview.html"> <img class="photo" src='Images\Pulp Fiction.jpg'> </a>
                    <p class="review-text">The least interesting thing about Pulp Fiction is what is in that bloody briefcase. Whether it is unlimited moolah, the soul of Crime Lord Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) or the gold lame suit worn by Val Kilmer's Elvis in True Romance (1993) really misses the point of a picture. Making a mockery of the difficult-second-film cliche. Peppered with great moments eaten up by actors working at the top of their game (Travolta, Willis and Thurman have never been better, and the film created the aura of greatness that currently surrounds Jackson) Pulp's witty writing, pop culture-surfing, gleeful amorality, cult tuneology and hyperkinetic energy has redefined the crime genre for the foreseeable future.</p>
